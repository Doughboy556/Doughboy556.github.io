I am a first year computer science major at CSUF and I'm going to graduate in 2028.


## Favorite CPSC 120 labs


BlackJack Lab
I really liked this lab because in the lecture we always talk about blackjack
and I'm very intrested in casino games as well. And Since we talked so much
about the game that I know the most it helped me get comfortable in the class.
I also liked this lab because I like labs having to do with logic.


Parking Lab
I liked this lab just not as much as the blackjack lab. Once again because
I like to deal with logic problems. But this one really stumped me so it wasn't
too fun.


Spelling correct Lab
I liked this lab because to me this was on of the first labs where we actually
saw how coding is used in the real world. Because obvisoliy everything has spelling
checks now so you see how to build that in to a program.
